# My point of <span v-mark>Vue</span>

<!--
[click] Hello everyone.

I'm really excited to be here.

Today I'll talk about [click] the many ways of writing a component in vue, [click] nuxt and nitro, the actual write once, deploy everywhere frameworks, [click] touch on some useful integrations and other tools in the ecosystem and [click] finally, if I still have some time, I'll tell you about sli.dev

At the end or this talk, I hope to have added one or two new items into your toolbox and re-enabled you to look at web development from 

[click] my point of view.
